## Investigators

[Prasanna Balaprakash, Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~pbalapra)

<img src="files/img/prasanna.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Prasanna Balaprakash is an assistant computer scientist with a joint appointment in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division and the Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. His research interests span the areas of machine learning, numerical optimization, and performance engineering. His current research focus is on the design, development, and analysis of algorithms for solving large-scale problems that arise in automating the tuning of computer codes and on computationally expensive design-space explorations. In RAMSES, he is responsible for developing statistical machine learning methods for surrogate performance models.

[Sven Leyffer, Argonne National Laboratory](http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/Sven_Leyffer)

<img src="files/img/leyffer_100.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Sven is interested in the development of reliable methods for solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems and in the implementation and analysis of filter type algorithms. This forms the basis from which I am extending nonlinear optimization methodologies to emerging areas such as mixed-integer nonlinear optimization and optimization problems with complementarity constraints.

[Todd Munson, Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~tmunson/)

<img src="files/img/munson.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Todd is interested in large-scale optimization methods for simulation constrained optimization problems using high-performance architectures, hierarchical optimization problems with discrete choices, and nonsmooth dynamical systems including differential variational inequalities and complementarity constraints.  His primary contribution to this project is in using numerical optimization to estimate model parameters based on available data.

[Vitali Morozov, Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/vitali-morozov)

<img src="files/img/VitaliMorozov-ANL.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Vitali Morozov is a Principal Application Performance Engineer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. At Argonne since 2001, he has been working on computer simulation of plasma generation, plasma material interactions, plasma thermal and optical properties, and applications to laser and discharge-produced plasmas. At the ALCF, he has been working on performance projections and studying the hardware trends in high performance computing, as well as porting and tuning applications on supercomputers.

[Venkatram Vishwanath, Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/person/venkatram-vishwanath)

<img src="files/img/Venkat_web.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Venkatram Vishwanath is a computer scientist  at the Argonne National Laboratory. His research interests span the areas of large-scale data movement and management, scalable data analysis and visualization, in situ analytics, and performance modeling.  In RAMSES, he leads the performance modeling and performance projections for exascale simulations and in situ workflows on current and future supercomputing systems.

[Zhengchun Liu, Argonne National Laboratory](http://zliu.info)

<img src="files/img/zhengchun_liu.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Zhengchun Liu is a postdoctoral appointee at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory. In this project, he develops end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. More specifically, these models are developed to predict the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to explain why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.
