[Sven Leyffer, Argonne National Laboratory](http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/Sven_Leyffer) (RAMSES-1)

<img src="files/img/leyffer_100.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Sven is interested in the development of reliable methods for solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems and in the implementation and analysis of filter type algorithms. This forms the basis from which I am extending nonlinear optimization methodologies to emerging areas such as mixed-integer nonlinear optimization and optimization problems with complementarity constraints.

[Zhengchun Liu](http://zliu.info), [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~zcliu/) (RAMSES-1 and RAMSES-2)

<img src="files/img/zhengchun_liu.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100px;"/>

Zhengchun Liu is a postdoctoral appointee at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory. In this project, he develops end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. More specifically, these models are developed to predict the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to explain why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.
