The RAMSES project aims to develop a new science of end-to-end analytical performance modeling that will transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. Much as modern design tools permit digital pre-assembly and simulated flight of new aircraft before they are built, predictive control during flight, and predictive trending for failure detection, our new methods will provide a basis for tools that allow developers and users of science workflows and operators of science facilities to predict, explain, and optimize.
